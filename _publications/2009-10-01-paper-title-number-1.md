excerpt: 'Advancements in neurosurgical robotics have improved medical procedures, particularly deep brain stimulation, where robots combine human and machine intelligence to precisely implant electrodes in the brain. While effective, this procedure carries risks and side effects. Noninvasive deep brain stimulation (NIDBS) offers promise by making brain stimulation safer, more affordable, and accessible. However, NIDBS lacks guidelines for electrode placement. This study explores adapting robotic principles to enhance the accuracy of NIDBS targeting and provides preliminary guidelines for transcranial electrode placement. Safety is also emphasized, ensuring a balance between therapeutic effectiveness and patient safety by maintaining electric fields within safe limits.'
